## Supported Systems

We build and test Automagik Forge on the following systems:

- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Linux
- Windows

## Prerequisites

Before installing Automagik Forge, ensure you have:

- **Node.js**: Latest LTS version recommended
- **Coding agent authentication**: Authenticate with your preferred coding agents outside of Automagik Forge

## Safety Notice

<Warning>
Automagik Forge runs AI agents with --dangerously-skip-permissions/--yolo flags by default so they can work autonomously without constant approval prompts. Each task runs in an isolated git worktree, preventing agents from interfering with each other.
Agents can still perform system-level actions, so review their work and keep backups.
</Warning>

## Installation & Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Authenticate with a coding agent">
  Before launching Automagik Forge, ensure you're authenticated with at least one [supported coding agent](/supported-coding-agents). Follow the installation and authentication instructions for your preferred agent.
</Step>

<Step title="Install and launch Automagik Forge">
  Open a terminal and run:

  ```bash
  npx automagik-forge

  The application will bind to a random free port, print the URL in the terminal, and automatically open in your default browser.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Complete initial setup">
  Complete the setup dialogs to configure your coding agent and editor preferences. GitHub authentication is optional and can be configured later.
</Step>

<Step title="Create your first project">
  You'll land on the Projects page, populated with your three most recently active git projects if automatically discovered. Click "Create project" to add more projects.
</Step>

<Step title="Add tasks">
  Start tracking your work by [creating tasks](/core-features/creating-tasks) within your project.
</Step>

<Step title="Optional: Configure GitHub integration">
  Connect to GitHub in [Settings](/configuration-customisation/global-settings) to enable branch management and pull request creation.
</Step>

<Step title="Optional: Set up MCP integration">
  Streamline task creation with coding agents by [setting up MCP integration](/integrations/automagik-forge-mcp-server).
</Step>
</Steps>
