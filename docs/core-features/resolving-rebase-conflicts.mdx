## When You See "Rebase Conflicts"

After clicking the rebase button, if your changes conflict with the base branch, your task status changes to "Rebase conflicts" and a conflict resolution banner appears.

The conflict banner provides three options to resolve the situation:

</Frame>

- **Resolve Conflicts** - Auto-generate resolution instructions for the coding agent
- **Open in Editor** - Manually edit conflicted files
- **Abort Rebase** - Cancel and return to previous state

## Resolving Conflicts Automatically

The simplest solution is to let the coding agent resolve conflicts automatically:

1. Click **Resolve Conflicts** from the conflict banner to generate specific instructions tailored to your conflict situation and insert them into the follow-up message area.

2. Review the generated instructions and click **Resolve Conflicts** (the Send button changes to this) to have the agent analyse the conflicted files and complete the rebase automatically.

</Frame>

Once the agent completes the resolution, your task status will show *n* commits ahead and the **Merge** button becomes available again.

## Manual Resolution (Alternative)

If you prefer to resolve conflicts manually, you have two options:

**For single files:** Use **Open in Editor** from the conflict banner to edit one conflicted file at a time. After resolving and refreshing the page, you can press the button again for the next file.

**For multiple files (recommended):** Click the triple dot icon at the top right of the task and select **Open in [Your IDE]** to open all worktree files in your chosen IDE, where you can resolve all conflicts at once.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your IDE">
  Click the triple dot icon at the top right and select **Open in [Your IDE]** to access all worktree files, or use **Open in Editor** from the banner for individual files.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit conflicted files">
  Resolve merge markers in each file:
  
  ```diff
  <<<<<<< HEAD (your changes)
  function newFeature() {
    return "new implementation";
  }
  =======
  function oldFeature() {
    return "existing implementation";
  }
  >>>>>>> main (base branch changes)
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Continue the rebase">
  After editing all conflicts, stage and continue:
  
  ```bash
  git add .
  git rebase --continue
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Automatic resolution works best for most conflicts. Use manual resolution only when you need precise control over the merge decisions.
</Tip>

## Aborting a Rebase

If you need to cancel the rebase entirely, click **Abort Rebase** to return to the "Rebase needed" state. You can then try rebasing again or create a new task attempt from the updated base branch.

## Rebasing onto a Different Base Branch

If you've changed the base branch of your task attempt and see commits unrelated to your changes, you can use `git rebase --onto` to rebase only your work onto the new base:

```bash
git rebase <last-commit-before-your-work> --onto <new-base>
```

### Example Scenario

You accidentally created a task attempt from the `develop` branch, but it should have been based on `main`. After changing the base branch to `main` in the task settings, you see commits from `develop` that aren't part of your work:

```bash
# Find the last commit before your work started (e.g., in the git log)
# Then rebase only your commits onto main
git rebase 64d504c94d076070d17affd3f84be63b34515445 --onto main
```

This command takes your commits (everything after the specified commit hash) and replays them onto `main`, excluding the unrelated commits from `develop`.

<Warning>
Use `git rebase --onto` carefully. Make sure you identify the correct commit hashâ€”the last commit that isn't part of your current task. Consider creating a backup branch first: `git branch backup-branch`.
</Warning>
