## When You See "Rebase Conflicts"

After clicking the rebase button, if your changes conflict with the base branch, your task status changes to "Rebase conflicts" and a conflict resolution banner appears.

</Frame>

The conflict banner provides three options to resolve the situation:

</Frame>

- **Open in Editor** - Manually edit conflicted files
- **Insert Resolve-Conflicts Instructions** - Auto-generate resolution instructions for the coding agent
- **Abort Rebase** - Cancel and return to previous state

## Resolving Conflicts Automatically

The simplest solution is to let the coding agent resolve conflicts automatically:

1. Click **Insert Resolve-Conflicts Instructions** from the conflict banner to generate specific instructions tailored to your conflict situation and insert them into the follow-up message area.

2. Review the generated instructions and click **Send** to have the agent analyse the conflicted files and complete the rebase automatically.

</Frame>

Once the agent completes the resolution, your task status will show *n* commits ahead and the **Merge** button becomes available again.

## Manual Resolution (Alternative)

If you prefer to resolve conflicts manually, you have two options:

**For single files:** Use **Open in Editor** from the conflict banner to edit one conflicted file at a time. After resolving and refreshing the page, you can press the button again for the next file.

**For multiple files (recommended):** Use the **Open in [Your IDE]** button from the Actions pane to open all worktree files in your chosen IDE, where you can resolve all conflicts at once.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your IDE">
  Click **Open in [Your IDE]** from the Actions pane to access all worktree files, or use **Open in Editor** from the banner for individual files.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit conflicted files">
  Resolve merge markers in each file:
  
  ```diff
  <<<<<<< HEAD (your changes)
  function newFeature() {
    return "new implementation";
  }
  =======
  function oldFeature() {
    return "existing implementation";
  }
  >>>>>>> main (base branch changes)
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Continue the rebase">
  After editing all conflicts, stage and continue:
  
  ```bash
  git add .
  git rebase --continue
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Aborting a Rebase

If you need to cancel the rebase entirely, click **Abort Rebase** to return to the "Rebase needed" state. You can then try rebasing again or create a new task attempt from the updated base branch.

<Tip>
Automatic resolution works best for most conflicts. Use manual resolution only when you need precise control over the merge decisions.
