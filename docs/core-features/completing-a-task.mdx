When your task is finished, Automagik Forge provides integrated git operations to keep your branch up-to-date and merge your work back into the base branch.

## Git Operations Header

At the top of the diff view, you'll see important branch information and actions:

<Frame>
<img src="/images/af-diff-header.png" alt="Diff header showing branch information and action buttons" />
</Frame>

**Branch Information:**
- **Task branch**: The branch your task is working on
- **Target branch**: The branch you'll merge into (with cog button to change it)
- **Commits ahead**: Number of commits your branch has that aren't in the target
- **Commits behind**: Number of commits in the target that you don't have (enables rebase button when >0)

**Actions:**
- **Merge**: Merge your changes into the target branch
- **Create PR**: Create a pull request on GitHub
- **Rebase**: Update your branch with the latest changes from the target branch

## Rebase

Click **Rebase** to update your branch with the latest changes from the target branch. This keeps your branch up-to-date and maintains a clean history.

If conflicts occur, see [Resolving Rebase Conflicts](/core-features/resolving-rebase-conflicts).

## Merge

Click **Merge** to integrate your completed work into the target branch. Your task will automatically move to the **Done** column, and the worktree is cleaned up automatically. The branch remains until you manually delete it.

<Tip>
If you're working with GitHub, consider creating a pull request instead of merging directly. This allows for team review and CI checks.
</Tip>

## Pull Request Management

### Creating a Pull Request

Click **Create PR** to create a pull request on GitHub. The title and description are auto-populated from your task details.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/af-pr-open.png" alt="Header showing disabled Push button after pull request creation" />
</Frame>

After creating the PR, the button changes to **Push** (initially disabled until you make more changes).

### Updating a Pull Request

When you continue working after creating a PR, the **Push** button becomes enabled. Click it to push your latest changes to the pull request.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/af-pr-with-push.png" alt="Header showing enabled Push button with new changes ready" />
</Frame>

When your PR is merged on GitHub, your task automatically moves to **Done**.
